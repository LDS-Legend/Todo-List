✨ Simple To-Do List Application
This project is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The main goal of this application is to provide a basic understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

🚀 Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which will visually differentiate them from incomplete tasks.
Persistent Data: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so the list is maintained even after the page is refreshed.
